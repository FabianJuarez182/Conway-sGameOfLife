# Conway-sGameOfLife

Using only the point function we prepared in the past laboratory, you must implement Conway's game of life algorithm.

## Using Linux

First you need to install WSL, C++ with CMake and SDL

Then you need to run this command with the repository clone and in the folder Conway-sGameOfLife

```shell
./run.sh
```

Then we can see a screen with the game like this
